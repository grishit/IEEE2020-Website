									</header>
									<p>The zenith of the relentless efforts of IEEE ADGITM is realized in the form of PES Day. An
                    event marked to celebrate the accomplishments of IEEE's oldest society PES. PES, the Power,
                    and Energy Society of IEEE ADGITM constantly strive to apply scientific and engineering
                    prowess to radicalize Electricity and Power. With an inspiring agenda in mind, PES- focuses on
                    conceiving new forms of renewable energy and mechanisms to be implemented into everyday
                    life. The Ideathon, a competition in which participants had to present their abstract ideas in a
                    written form. The competition observed entries from all across the world. To everyone's
                    astonishment entries from as far as Kerala, Jordan, and Australia were received. Without the
                    shadow of a doubt, the event ticked all boxes in the checklist of a successful event.</p>

										<h2>MEMBERSHIP DRIVE</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The aim of the counselling-cum-recruitment drive was to enlighten students about the variety
                    of careers one can opt for and plan for a journey with IEEE. The session was to help students
                    learn about the new technologies, their implementation and to educate them on the innovative
                    ways in which they can showcase it to others.
                    The drive got a staggering 150+ applications. It started with a group discussion/chat with the
                    students which was followed by a small fun quiz for both the team and students to know one
                    another better. The chat was followed by a one on one interview cum counseling session of the
                    students with the executive committee members.</p>

										<h2>SCRATCH TO MARVELS</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The workshop was organized for the 1st year and 2nd year students of all departments of
                    ADGITM keeping in mind their technical interest and with the aim to provide them a great start
                    for their respective technical fields. The speakers started the session by explaining the true
                    meaning of the word ‘Engineers’. The whole workshop was explained with the help of a
                    presentation. The first activity done by the students was making an LED glow using breadboard,
                    battery, resistors and jumper wires. students were given a task to blink an LED using Arduino
                    and Arduino IDE. A brief introduction to all types of sensors was given to the students while
                    making them realize how much they are surrounded by sensors in their everyday life. The session
                    ended on a good note as the students were very happy to learn something new while their future
                    plans could be seen in their eyes.</p>

										<h2>TECHNORAX V5.0</h2>
									</header>
									<p>IEEE ADGITM celebrated IEEE DAY on 9th and 10th October 2019 as its annual flagship
                    event TECHNORAX V5.0 which is also the official technical fest of Dr. Akhilesh Das Gupta
                    Institute of Technology and Management. The celebration was much more enthusiastic and
                    grander from the previous ones with technical as well as non-technical events. Initiation of the
                    new events like 24 Hour Hackathon, Treasure Hunt, Tug of Bots, LFR Race, Bottle Rocket
                    helped in encouraging students and professionals to take up engineering as a passion and not
                    profession. This also helped the students to know more about IEEE as a community of
                    enthusiastic and passionate engineers who work for the betterment of society.

										<h2>Think & Research- IEEE PES ADGITM</h2>
									</header>
									<p>IEEE ADGITM organized a workshop called ‘Think and Research’ on 18th March 2019 at ADGITM’s auditorium. It was attended by students from different colleges, branches and years. The session was lead by Mr. Apoorv Arora and Mr. Aakash Bansal with a very informal casual discussion on “What exactly does research mean?” They explained the students how to think on a project and how to use resources judiciously. Further, they explained the students how they started their approach in this field. In their full interaction they mainly focused on the topic “idea inception” they told students some parameters, some principles on which their project must be work upon, some of them are Pareto Principle – 80/20 Rule - Result Oriented Mindset. Further the session continued with explanation on how to develop interest and aptitude, how to read and publish papers, networking and team building and also some communication techniques. They took an agenda of “the ultimate know how to research” and with this they took some basic points to discuss the importance of research and development.</p>

                  <p>The workshop was organized on account of Women’s day to teach women the self-defence techniques to feel more confident, secure and gain a sense of self-sufficiency. The workshop was taken by Suraj Sharma, Founder of Tackle Self	 Defense Foundation and his team.
                      Along with the students, faculty from different departments also took part in the workshop. The session commenced with some basic important tips and tricks to tackle common situations. Props (e.g. a plastic knife) used in the session created real life-like situations. The presence of a female trainer also marked a hint of reliance and comfort for the girls who showed up for the workshop. The trainer Suraj and his team created a safe and comfortable atmosphere during the class. The techniques he showed and taught were very basic and clear, understandable for everyone. The exercises and techniques involved the participants making it a fun and interactive session on both ends. A letter of appreciation was presented to Mr Suraj and his team at the end of the session.</p>

                </header>
                <p>IEEE NIEC (now IEEE ADGITM) successfully organized the Machine Learning workshop on 13th August,2018 in the auditorium of Dr. Akhilesh Das Gupta Institute of Technology and Management. The Machine Learning workshop was organized in collaboration with Coding Ninjas, one of the best programming institutes in Delhi. The session began with Mr. Jasneet Singh (Our CS Representative) introducing Mr. Parikh Jain. He is a product engineer and instructor at Coding ninjas and also a co- founder at booksquare.in. He is truly a ninja of Competitive Programming and Machine Learning.
                    After introduction, the stage was taken up by Mr. Parikh. He started the session with a discussion about general programming languages and then explained what Machine Learning is. He asked a few basic questions on machine learning and what does it actually mean, to which the participants answered quite interestingly.
                    Now, It was time to show some practical applications of machine learning for which the students were asked to install ANACONDA and Python so that the session would continue without any hindrance. The session was now slowly coming to an end and further he asked the participants for some queries not only regarding machine learning but also regarding other programming languages and GITHUB. 
                    With the session coming to an end he also told the students about the scope of machine learning in the coming future. Cool goodies were provided to the students who took part in the interactive session actively</p>

                </header>
                <p>One of the biggest celebrations of technology in the world is the celebration of the IEEE day. All the members of IEEE all over the world celebrate IEEE day to mark the great technological advancements that have been done so far and to encourage young minds to come forward with their ideas to change the world.

                    IEEE NIEC(now IEEE ADGITM) celebrated the IEEE day from October 11th to October 12th, 2018 with version 4.0 of its flagship event Technorax. Technorax was started three years ago with only a technical exhibition. This time we decided to take it up one notch by organizing a two-day event comprised of four sub-events. Day one and two both comprised of two sub-events each. This time the name of the event was Technorax V-4.0.
                    The events included were Rob war the main of all the technical exhibitions which attracted crowds from other colleges as well, Technical Exhibition where the students of our college showcased their talents, Hackathon which proved out to be a big success and our only fun event Escape Trio which consisted of four rounds Chocolate eating followed by Movie Crossword followed by extempore and lastly Pictionary.
                    At last, when all the events were completed, the prize distribution ceremony took place in the amphitheatre. All the winners were given goodies and certificates. 
                    
                    A cake cutting ceremony at makers’ space marked the end of this energy-packed event. All the volunteers had lots of fun and celebrated IEEE day with exuberance and determination</p>
